	  <b>A Geometric Calculator</b>
	  <p>
	    The geometric calculator is just an ordinary desk
	    calculator that uses the Clifford Numbers over a three
	    dimensional Euclidean Space.
	  <p>
	    This means that in addition to doing the normal
	    computations on (computer implemented) real numbers that
	    you are used to finding on a desk calculator, this
	    calculator also computes on vectors in two and three
	    space, on the bivectors over those vectors, on the
	    trivector over three space, on complex numbers, and on
	    quaternions.
	  <p>
	    Now, that may be so much gobbledy gook to you, it was to
	    me once, but this set of computations is pretty
	    interesting in that it includes a lot of the practical
	    computations that people have learned to do in the past
	    few millenia:  computing areas and volumes, surveying,
	    planar navigation, celestial navigation, satellite control,
	    robotics, computer graphics, and more.
	  <p>
	    One way to put it is that numbers can be more than
	    simply magnitudes, we can have numbers with intrinsic
	    shapes, such as pointy numbers, flat numbers, solid
	    numbers, and round numbers.  The pointy numbers are more
	    commonly called vectors, at least by that part of the
	    population which calls them anything at all.  They are
	    pointy because they simply point in some direction.  If we 
	    take two pointy numbers which point in different
	    directions, we can combine them to make a flat number,
	    also known as a bivector.  This operation, combining two
	    pointy numbers to get a flat one, is called the wedge or
	    outer product, and it's key on the calculator is labelled 
	    with something like <b>^</b>.  The magnitude of a flat
	    number is an area, the area of a parallelogram defined by
	    the two pointy numbers wedged together.  If we're working
	    in three dimensions we can wedge a third pointy number
	    onto the flat number to get a solid number, also known as
	    a trivector.  The magnitude of the solid number is the
	    volume of the parallelopiped defined by the three pointy
	    numbers wedged together.
	  <p>
	    I don't have a cute vulgarization to explain the round
	    numbers, yet.  So you will have to take my word that if
	    you combine a simple magnitude with a flat number you get
	    a number which can be used as an operator which scales and 
	    rotates pointy numbers and flat numbers.  Round numbers
	    are also known as complex numbers and as quaternions.
	  <p>
	    My apologies for the incompleteness of all this.  There's
	    a lot more to be said, but other duties call.  And I have
	    a terrible time figuring out who I'm writing this for, the 
	    first question any author really ought to answer.
            </p><p>
              To allow you to experiment with the calculator as a
              local application, I have made a
              <a href="calculator.jar">jar file</a> with all you need
              to run the calculator.  The jar unzips (using the usual
              cast of unzip utilities) to create a directory named
              "calculator" which contains, among many other files, a
              file named "index.html" which has a link to start the
              calculator window.
