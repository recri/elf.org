	  <b>Ffidl Version 0.5</b>
	  <p>
	    <a href="index.html">Ffidl</a>
	      allows you to call C functions using pure Tcl wrappers.
	      You specify a function name, a library, a list of
	      argument types, and a return type, and Ffidl takes care
	      of the nasty details of converting a Tcl command call
	      into a C function call for you.
	      So, if you have a shared library and a specification of
	      the entries in the library, you can wrap the library
	      into a Tcl extension with Ffidl and pure Tcl.
	  <p>
	      Ffidl 0.5 adds support for Windows and synchronous
	      callbacks from C functions into Tcl on the x86
	      architecture, the option of using the GPL'ed ffcall
	      package, introduces a ::ffidl:: namespace, renames
	      ffidl-proc to ::ffidl::callout, and adds some options to
	      ::ffidl::info.
	  <p>
	      Ffidl uses
	      <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/libffi/">
		libffi-2.00-beta
	      </a>, with substantial patches, to dynamically construct
	      calls to C functions from Tcl, and on the x86 architecture,
	      to dynamically construct calls from C functions into Tcl.
	      Libffi has officially been ported to:
	    <ul>
	      <li>SunOS 4.1.3 &amp; Solaris 2.x (Sparc v8)</li>
	      <li>Irix 5.3 &amp; 6.2 (System V/o32 &amp; n32)</li>

	      <li>PowerPC - Linux (System V ABI)</li>
	      <li>ARM - Linux (System V ABI)</li>
	    </ul>
	    This release of Ffidl also includes support for
	    <ul>
	      <li>Intel x86 - Mingw32 (cdecl and stdcall)</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>
	      Ffidl can also be configured (--enable-ffcall) to use

	    <p>
	      Ffidl uses <b>dlopen()</b> and <b>dlsym()</b>, or their
	      Windows approximations <b>LoadLibrary()</b> and
	      <b>GetProcAddress</b>, to load dynamic libraries and
	      discover the locations of functions.
	    <p>
	      Ffidl was developed under linux-2.0.36, linux-2.2.5, and
	      Windows 95 using Tcl8.2.1.  It should be able to run on
	      any system with a stubs enabled Tcl, libffi or ffcall
	      support, and a libdl implementation.  
	    <p>
	      Ffidl 0.5 is a second alpha release.  There have been
	      about 50 downloads of Ffidl 0.1, the first alpha, in the
	      past weeks, but only one person has reported on his
	      experiences.  There are configuration details which you
	      will need to attend to by hand in the current release.
	      The initial development turned up a few bugs in libffi
	      under linux-x86, so users on other architectures should
	      be alert for similar problems.  There are several open
	      design issues still to be resolved, so there may be
	      changes in the interfaces in future releases.  There are
	      several common Tcl/Tk platforms which need ports of
	      libffi or implementations of libdl.
	    <p>
	      I'm releasing at this early point because it's really too
	      much fun to keep to myself, I need assistance verifying
	      that the implementation works on all the architectures
	      supported by libffi, and the open design issues could use
	      some discussion.
	    <p>
	      <b><a name="commands">Commands, Functions, and Procs</a></b>
	    <p>
	      Ffidl defines five Tcl commands in the <b>Ffidl</b>

	      <b><a name="install">Installation</a></b>
	    <p>
	      Building on linux has been painless, but building on
	      Windows has yet to be replicated by anyone but myself.
	      The <b>binaries</b> directory contains some prebuilt
	      libs.
	    <p>
	      Installation on linux consists of:
	    <pre>
tar xzvf ffidl-0.5.tar.gz
cd ffidl-0.5
configure &amp;&amp; make</pre>
	    Installation under windows consists of:
	    <pre>
unzip ffidl05.zip
cd ffidl-0.5
CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" ./configure
make -f Makefile.gnu</pre>
	    The Windows build is very, very picky.  It assumes that you have 
	    <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">Cygwin-B20</a>
	    installed with Mumit Khan's <a href="index05.html">gcc-2.95</a>
	    update, and with the libtclstub82.a from an install of
	    Jan Nijtman's
	    <a href="http://members1.chello.nl/~j.nijtmans/plus.html">
	      tcl82*plus.exe
	    </a>.
	    <p>
	      The Windows Makefile.gnu contains instructions for
	      compiling ffcall, but it doesn't link as a dll under
	      cygwin.
	    <p>
	      Three custom configure options are implemented for
	      selecting between libffi and ffcall, --enable-libffi and
	      --enable-ffcall, and for excluding callbacks,

(cd libffi-2.00-beta && ./ffitest)</pre>
	    will run libffi's test suite.

	    will run ffcall's self test.
	    <p>
	      At this point you should edit <b>demos/ffidlrt.tcl</b> and
	      look at the table of libraries in
	      <b>::ffidlrt::libs</b> and the table of types in
	      <b>::ffidlrt::types</b>.  Either or both of these tables
	      will probably need attention if you go further.  You may
	      need, for instance, to find, build, or install libraries
	      for gmp and gdbm, or to adjust the pathnames for libc,
	      libm, tcl, and tk.
	      (The ever useful Mumit Khan has a gmp port for Windows,
	      <a href="ftp://ftp.xraylith.wisc.edu/pub/khan/gnu-win32/mingw32/ports/">
		gmp-dll-2.0.2-mingw32.zip,
	      </a>
	      available for download, which will allow Windozens to
	      run the multiprecision demos.)
	    <p>
	      Running
	    <pre>
make test</pre>
	    or
	    <pre>
make -f Makefile.gnu test</pre>
	    will build a test shared lib and run a series of scripts in
	    <b>demos/</b> which run to completion without error messages
	    on my system.  It is not quite a systematic test suite, but
	    it does exercise a good deal of Ffidl's capabilities, and it
	    has turned up some problems with libffi.
	    <p>
	      The configure for Ffidl started from the TEA sample
	      configuration, but it needs more work.  It doesn't test
	      that libdl is actually available.  It builds the
	      ffidl_test library and runs the test scripts in
	      <b>demos/</b>, but it wasn't clear how Makefile.in was
	      supposed to support this or cleaning up test binaries.
	      Most glaringly, I couldn't get the Windows configure to
	      work at all, so I gave up and wrote a makefile.gnu by
	      hand.
	    <p>
	      The included copy of libffi-2.00-beta has been
	      rewritten from a copy retrieved via cvs on
	      October 28, 1999.  The distributed libffi-2.00-beta
	      erroneously makes "long int" a 64 bit integer on x86,
	      and the inline assembly for implementing closures
	      miscompiled on two out of two gcc's. If you have
	      installed a copy of libffi on your machine, beware of
	      finding the unpatched headers in /usr/local/include
	      before the patched ones.
	    <p>
	      <b><a name="demos">Demos</a></b>

	    <p>
	      <b>ffidlrt.tcl</b> will need attention unless you're
	      running on my machine.  There are two functions,
	      <b>::ffidl::find-lib</b> and <b>::ffidl::find-type</b>, which
	      abstract library names and system typedefs out of the
	      rest of the code.  However, the abstraction is currently
	      limited to the correct results for my Linux box.  You'll
	      need to rewrite the mapping for your own machine.
	    <p>
	      <b>ffidlrt.tcl</b> also contains some examples of
	      binding into the Tcl core itself.
	    <p>
	      <b>tkphoto.tcl</b> allows extraction and insertion of
	      photo image pixels as binary data.  See
	      <b>test-tkphoto.tcl</b> for an example.
	    <p>
	      The <b>gdbm.tcl</b> extension should be plug compatible
	      with Tclgdbm0.6, a C coded Tcl extension for manipulating
	      gdbm files.  Since gdbm passes and returns structures, it
	      also tests the Ffidl struct code.
	    <p>
	      The <b>gmp*.tcl</b> extensions make a nice example.  The
	      main Gmp package wraps all the exported mpz_*, mpq_*, and
	      mpf_* entries from the Gnu multiple precision library.
	      The subsidiary Gmp[zqf] packages use the Gmp package to
	      define arbitrary precision integers, rationals, and floats
	      which are represented as strings. This isn't the most
	      efficient way to do arbitrary precision arithmetic, but it
	      is convenient, it does avoid needing to know what type 
	      mp_limb_t and mp_size_t actually are, and it does show how 
	      to use the underlying library if you want to build
	      something more efficient.
	    <p>
	      <b><a name="performance">Performance</a></b>
	    <p>
	      Performance appears to be excellent, but I can't take any
	      credit because libffi is doing most of the work.  The
	      <b>demos/time-libm.tcl</b> script compares
	      <b>::ffidl::callout</b> wrapped libm functions to the Tcl expr
	      versions of the same functions.  On UNIX, the "make
	      test" target will build libmathswig0.5.so to provide a
	      SWIG wrapped libm for comparison purposes.  If you're
	      running on Linux-x86 or Windows you can install Robin
	      Becker's ::dll for another data point.
	      <b>time-libm.tcl</b> will time them on the same functions.
	    <p>
	      The Ffidl bindings to libm run a little faster than ::dll
	      bindings and a little slower than SWIG wrappers, all of
	      them coming in slower than expr itself.  The bottom line
	      is that all three extensions run better than 1.5 times the
	      speed of expr over the same functions.
	    <p>
	      <b><a name="issues">Open Issues</a></b>
	    <p>
	      A few issues have been closed since the initial release.
	    <p>
	      The Windows port is done.
	    <p>
	      Callbacks are implemented for the x86 architecture.
	    <p>
	      But there are many open issues.
	    <p>
	      Port to macintosh and other architectures.
	    <p>
	      Importing libdl compatability code from Tcl.  It would be
	      real nice if the Tcl core exported some neatly packaged
	      libdl abstraction, since it has the wherewithal
	      implemented for <b>load</b> already.
	    <p>
	      Finding the right library is a pain.  dlopen("libm.so")
	      finds libm on my machine, but dlopen("libc.so") returns an
	      error string decorated with binary characters while
	      dlopen("libc.so.6") works.  If you work with shared
	      libraries you build yourself, it's not an issue, but for
	      all the standard stuff there is no standard.  In
	      <b>demos/ffidlrt.tcl</b> the <b>::ffidl::find-lib</b>
	      function provides an abstraction for at least removing
	      these issues one layer away from your Ffidl bindings to
	      the library, but the implementation of the abstraction
	      hasn't gone farther than listing where I find my standard
	      libraries.
	    <p>
	      Discovering what type a type is is also a pain.  Include
	      headers are typically so heavily conditionalized, that
	      one needs to search and search to find which typedef is
	      actually implemented.  In <b>demos/ffidlrt.tcl</b> the 
	      <b>::ffidl::find-type</b> function abstracts these issues
	      out of the Ffidl bindings, but again the implementation
	      of the abstraction will need some work.
	    <p>
	      A backend for SWIG which generates Ffidl bindings might
	      be useful.
	    <p>
	      There are some more pointer types which ought to be
	      defined: a variant of pointer-var which requires an
	      unshared value; a pointer to a native character string -- 
	      but couldn't that be pushed back to the Tcl layer?
	    <p>
	      Writing Tcl extensions with Ffidl is very much like
	      writing C code in Tcl.  I'm not sure what the actual
	      required skill set is.  But if you're not sure what
	      you're doing, you might be in over your head.  In any
	      case, try not to take the core dumps personally.
	    <p>
	      Loading snippets of code into a Tcl interpreter with
	      Ffidl loaded could be very hazardous, as in downloading
	      "Try ME!" scripts from the web.  There is no
	      Ffidl_SafeInit(), we'd probably need signed scripts to
	      even begin to consider such a thing.
	    <p>
	      I've looked at SWIG and at dll and seen that they very
	      carefully duplicate any shared Tcl_Obj before attempting
	      a conversion to Int or Double.  I've also looked at the
	      source for Tcl's expr command, and it converts objects
	      to Double or Int and only duplicates shared objects when
	      it finds a valid Int or a Double with an existing string
	      representation.  Ffidl only duplicates shared objects
	      when processing pointer-var, though I'm open to
	      explanations why it should do otherwise.  It seems that
	      if you pass a parameter to a typed function that you
	      shouldn't be upset if the parameter is converted to that
	      type.
	    <p>
	      Hmm, this is a really pared to the bone.  It would be
	      nice for newbies and experimenters and the careless if
	      Ffidl implemented a debugging mode which verified that
	      constraints were observed: 1) that Tcl_Obj string reps
	      were not modified, 2) that Tcl_Obj bytearray reps were
	      not modified outside their allocated sizes, and so on.
	      This could be done by switching in an alternate
	      implementation of tcl_ffidl_call() which made copies and
	      verified the constraints after the call.
	    <p>
	      Some naming consistency in the demos.  I seem to be
	      reinventing my Ffidl extension style each time I start a
	      new example.
	    <p>
	      Some style consistency in the tests.  The tests just
	      run, some generate descriptions, some report what
	      they've done, some say nothing, some give summaries.
	    <p>
