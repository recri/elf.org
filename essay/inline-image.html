	    <b>Inline Images on Web Pages</b>
	  </a>
	  <p>It would be really nice if images could be included
	    inside JavaScript or otherwise inlined into a web page
	    rather than always being fetched from the web server.
	  <p>Firstly, it would give us some more control over the
	    presentation of our ideas.  When I put up a desk
	    calculator, I want all of the button images to display at
	    once.  I don't want my users watching an unscripted
	    animation as the images are one by one stitched over the
	    skeleton of my page.  I don't want them looking at
	    skeletons at all, I want them to see the complete 
	    web page.
	  <p>Secondly, it would give us more flexibility.  If my
	    client side script needs a particular image, there's no
	    reason why I should have to make a roundtrip to Timbuktu
	    for a precomputed image or so a server side program can
	    generate the image.  I can draw it on the client side so I 
	    should be able to insert it into the page.
	  <p>So, given that a JavaScript could compute or simply store 
	    an image in some format, how does it get the browser to
	    display the image? There are three ways, none of which
	    works as well as I'd like.
	  <p>I should mention that haven't spent much time exploring
	    these issues with Internet Explorer.   Most of my
	    JavaScript seems to give Explorer indigestion, and IE's 
	    script error reporting is abysmal.   So anyone who can
	    enlighten me further on IE's capabilities for inline image 
	    display should do so.
	  <p>And eventually these issues will go away. The W3 has a 
	    proposed Scalable Vector Graphics standard, <a
	      href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a>, which will make 
	    for some very spiffy client side graphics if anyone ever
	    implements it.

	  <p>
	    <a name="document">
	      <b>Document.open()</b>
	    </a>
	  <p>The <b>document.open</b>(<i>mimeType</i>) method appears
	    to support the following way of replacing a document with
	    a computed image.<pre><code
>document.open("image/gif");
document.write(gifImageData);
document.close();</code></pre
>
	  Both Goodman <a href="inline-image.html#bible">[1]</a> and Flanagan <a
	    href="inline-image.html#definitive">[2]</a> discuss this as if it works.
	  Unfortunately, the <b>document.write()</b> method in NN4+
	  truncates its data at the first ascii NUL character.  It's
	  reported that this worked in NN3, but I haven't confirmed
	  that.
	  <p>And even if it did work, it would be a less than ideal
	    solution since it would require inline images to exist in
	    layers which could be written into.  This would limit its
	    use to browsers with DHTML support and its usefulness to
	    pages which were written in a particular way.

	  <p>
	    <a name="data">
	      <b>Data URL</b>
	    </a>
	  <p>The
	    <a href="ftp://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-masinter-url-data-03.txt">
	      data url</a> format allows the value of a small object to be
	    encoded inline as base64 content.  This looks like
	    this:<pre><code
>&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,[...]&quot;&gt;</code></pre
>
	  where the [...] is replaced with the base64 encoded image
	  data. Since the content of an html element is limited, in
	  worst case, to 1024 bytes, only fairly small images could be
	  displayed this way.  (I'm not sure where my memory of this
	  limit comes from.)
	  <p>Another annoyance is that NN4+ only partially supports
	    data URLs.  A data URL may appear in HTML source, but if
	    you use one in JavaScript to update an Image.src you will get 
	    the message: <code>illegal URL method 'data:'</code>.
	    Thus it works only if the image data is written into the
	    web page, not in the general case.

	  <p>
	    <a name="javascript">
	      <b>JavaScript URL</b>
	    </a>
	  <p>The <code>javascript:imageData</code> method was offered
	    by <a href="http://www.irt.org/">Martin Webb</a> on the
	    comp.lang.javascript newsgroup when I asked for help.
	    This uses a javascript url to supply the value for the
	    <code>src=</code> attribute of an <code>IMG</code>
	    element, or for the <code>.src</code> property of an
	    <code>Image</code> object. The data is neither written nor
	    encoded, it is simply supplied as the result of a
	    javascript expression.  Thus we may write a url as:
	    <code><pre>javascript:'GIF89a\1\0\1\0\200[...]\1\0;'</pre></code>
	  which specifies a gif as a javascript literal string.  Or we
	  might store that data into a global variable:
	  <code><pre>var imageDataVar = 'GIF89a\1\0\1\0\200[...]\1\0;'</pre></code>
	  and then write the url as:
	  <code><pre>javascript:imageDataVar</pre></code>
	  which references the value of the variable.
	  Or we might write a function which returns the image data
	  string and write the url as:
	  <code><pre>javascript:functionReturningImage()</pre></code>
	  which calls the function to supply the image data.
	  <p>The drawbacks of this method are that it is browser
	    specific;  that it doesn't cache well; that it cannot be
	    used for multiple images on the same page unless special
	    efforts are made to keep Netscape from running multiple
	    threads in the JavaScript interpreter.
