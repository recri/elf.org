	  <b>Mankala</b>
	  <p><b>To Play</b>
	  <p>The mankala game above let's you play south against a Tcl
	    program playing north.  You play by clicking on one of the
	    stones in one of the six round pits along the bottom of
	    the board.
	  <p>
	    Mankala is a game played with stones or seeds on a board
	    with fourteen pits.  The south player plays from the six
	    small pits along the bottom of the board and scores stones
	    played into the larger home pit at the right edge of the
	    board.  The north player plays from the six small pits
	    along the top of the board and scores stones played into
	    the larger home pit at the left edge of the board.
	  <p>
	    A play consists of picking up the stones from one of your
	    play pits and sowing them one at a time counterclockwise
	    into your own play pits, your home pit, and your opponents
	    play pits.  If the last stone played in a turn lands in
	    your home pit, then you get to play again.  If the last
	    stone played lands in an empty play pit on your side of
	    the board, then you capture any stones in the play pit
	    opposite by moving them across the board into your play
	    pit.
	  <p>
	    The game ends when either player cannot take a turn.  You
	    score all stones in your pits.  The player with the most
	    stones wins.
	  <p>
	    Many variations of mankala exist.  The rules implemented
	    above incorporate a mutation in the rules that came with
	    the first mankala board I bought, a mutation which
	    lengthens the game.
