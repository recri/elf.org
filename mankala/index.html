<p>
The Mankala family of games must be among the oldest of
	    human entertainments.  They are played on a board with
	    fourteen pits in it, which could be scooped out of or
	    simply drawn on the ground.  The playing pieces could be
	    stones, seeds, or shells.
	 </p> <p>
	    If you have a Java enabled web browser, then a Mankala
	    game board will be popping up in its own window any time
	    now.  It will look like the board illustrated in the image
	    above.  Usually, the board will go away when you leave
	    this page, however some versions of Java, under some
	    conditions, will leave an orphaned window behind.
	 </p> <p>
	    <b>The Rules of the Games</b>
	 </p> <p>

	    The family of Mankala games -- at least those implemented
	    by this applet -- are played on a rectangular board with
	    fourteen pits.  The six roughly circular pits at the
	    bottom of the board are the <b>play pits</b> for the
	    <b>south</b> player.  The oval pit at the right edge of
	    the board is the <b>home pit</b> for the <b>south</b>
	    player.  The six pits along the top of the board and the
	    oval pit at the left edge of the board are the <b>play
	      pits</b> and the <b>home pit</b> for the <b>north</b>
	    player.
	 </p> <p>
	    The game begins by distributing 3, 4, 5, or 6
	    <b>stones</b> into each of the <b>play pits</b>.  A player
	    takes the <b>stones</b> from a <b>play pit</b> and
	    distributes them one by one into the play pits and into
	    the player's <b>home pit</b> moving counterclockwise
	    around the board.  The object of the game is to have the
	    most <b>stones</b> in your <b>home pit</b> at the end of
	    the game.
	 </p> <p>
	    This applet implements several variations of the basic
	    game which differ in the <b>pits</b> which may be played,
	    when a turn is finished, and when the game is finished.
	    These are logically simple variations which were easy to
	    implement, but they don't approach the variety of games
	    which people play.
	  <dl>
	    <dt>Symmetric<dd>
	      If the game is a <b>symmetric</b> variation, then
	      players are free to choose any of the <b>play pits</b>
	      on their turn, and the game is finished when all the
	      <b>play pits</b> are empty.   In the <b>asymmetric</b>
	      variations, a player may only choose one of her or his
	      own <b>play pits</b>, and the game is finished when
	      either player can no longer make a move.
	    <dt>Capture to Home<dd>
	      In the <b>capture to home</b> variation, if the last
	      <b>stone</b> played in a turn lands in an empty <b>play
		pit</b>, then any <b>stones</b> in the opposite
	      <b>play pit</b> are captured. The captured <b>stones</b>
	      are transferred to the capturing player's <b>home
		pit</b>.
	    <dt>Capture Across<dd>
	      In the <b>capture across</b> variation, if the last
	      <b>stone</b> played in a turn lands in an empty <b>play
		pit</b>, then any <b>stones</b> in the opposite
	      <b>play pit</b> are captured. The captured <b>stones</b>
	      are transferred into the capturing <b>play pit</b>.
	    <dt>Replay<dd>
	      In the <b>replay</b> variation, if the last <b>stone</b>
	      played in a turn lands in the <b>home pit</b>, then the
	      player takes another turn.
	    <dt>Continue<dd>
	      In the <b>continue</b> variation, if the last
	      <b>stone</b> played in a turn lands in a filled <b>play
		pit</b>, then the player picks up the stones in that
	      <b>play pit</b> and continues the turn.
	  </dl>
	  </p><p>
	    The <b>Mankala</b> game which I learned with my first
	    Mankala board corresponds to an <b>asymmetric</b> game
	    with <b>capture across</b>, <b>replay</b>, and <b>no
	      continue</b> variations played with 3 stones.
	  </p><p>
	    It turns out, after all these years, that I misread the
	    rules that came with that first board.  The game they
	    described used <b>capture to home</b> rather than
	    <b>capture across</b>.
	  </p><p>
	    The <b>Manbula</b> game which Caroline learned from Eric
	    corresponds to a <b>symmetric</b> game with <b>replay</b>,
	    <b>continue</b>, and <b>no capture</b> variations played
	    with 4 stones.

	    R. C. Bell, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486238555//elforg-20?dev-t=mason-wrapper%26camp=2025%26link_code=xm2"><i>Board and Table Games from Many
	      Civilizations</i></a> (Dover Publications, Inc., New York,
	    1979) describes seven variations of Mancala games from
	    Africa, India, and South America, none of which correspond
	    to any of the games this applet plays.  He mentions
	    several others in passing.
	  <p>
	    If you know of other variations or other names for
	    specific combinations of variations, please let
	    <a href="mailto:rec@elf.org">me</a> know about them.
	  <p>
	    <b>The Java Applet</b>
	  <p>

	    The Java applet allows you to choose any of the sixteen
	    possible combinations of Mankala games with 3, 4, 5, or 6
	    stones, to choose whether north or south plays first, and
	    to choose any of several strategies for north and south to
	    play.  Choosing any of these options from the menues will
	    immediately start a new game, even if the option chosen is
	    already selected.
	  <p>
	    In the <b>manual</b> strategy you are responsible for
	    picking the pit to play with a mouse click.  In the other
	    strategies the program will choose a pit one way or
	    another.  If you choose the <b>manual</b> strategy for
	    both north and south, then you can play yourself or with a
	    friend.  If you choose automated strategies for both north
	    and south, then the program will play itself.
	  <p>
	    The play is animated with visual highlighting.  When it is 
	    <b>north's</b> turn to play, all of <b>north's</b> pits
	    will flash once together.  The pit selected for play will
	    flash.  Each pit into which a stone is played will flash
	    in turn.  If a play results in a <b>capture</b> then the
	    captured pit and capturing pit will flash as the captured
	    <b>stones</b> are transferred.
	  <p>

	    There are two informational fields in the menubar.  One
	    displays the state of the game.  The other displays the
	    number of <b>stones</b> in the pit last entered by the
	    mouse cursor.  This is technically cheating  --  you're
	    supposed to remember how many stones are in each pit --
	    but since the computer never has to guess I figure you
	    shouldn't have to guess either.
	  <p>
	    If you want to download the applet for offline play, then
	    you need to download the three files in this
	    <a href="index.html">folder</a>.  Loading the HTML file,
	    which you may safely rename to a .htm extension, from your
	    disk into your browser should start the game.
	  <p>
	    Here is the <a href="/pub/Mankala.java">source</a> for
	    the applet.  The original program, which only implemented
	    Mankala itself, was written for Tcl/Tk, and the <a
	      href="/pub/mankala.tk">source</a> for that program is
	    also available.
