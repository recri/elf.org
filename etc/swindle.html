                <h2>A Hundred Words for Swindle</h2>
                <div class="clear-block">
		  <div id="node-18" class="node">
		    <span class="submitted">Fri, 02/27/2009 - 12:27 â€” rec</span>
		    <div class="content clear-block">
		      <p>You perhaps remember the story about Eskimos
		      having a large vocabulary devoted to the
		      varieties of snow?  Well, that was a swindle, an
		      urban myth.  The Inuit and other people who live
		      in snowy places don't have many more words for
		      snow than the rest of us who live in places that
		      are only intermittently snow bound.
		      Anthropologists took an initial estimate by
		      Franz Boas and over the course of the decades
		      snowballed the number into the hundreds.</p> 
		      <p>The idea, of course, was that important
		      aspects of the environment should generate
		      important proportions of the languages grown in
		      the environments.  But the idea falters when the
		      environment, however important, just doesn't
		      have enough variety to support a great deal of
		      vocabulary.  Snow is that way: it can be dry
		      snow, wet snow, crusty snow, or powder.  There
		      are about 20 so root terms for snow, and that
		      about exhausts the varieties worth naming.</p> 
		      <p>So, are we dealing with the same sort of
		      urban myth when Walter A. McDougall tells us
		      that "American English is uniquely endowed with
		      words connoting a swindle"?  He certainly gives
		      us a long list of words in American English, and
		      I've constructed my own long list from an online
		      thesaurus, but he doesn't attempt to produce any
		      comparable lists for other languages.  What he
		      does give us is an argument why it ought to be
		      so.</p> 
		      <p>The argument is that Americans have been
		      uniquely free to try things out, at first
		      because the colonial legislatures were
		      disinclined to import the restrictions of the
		      old-world, or do anything else, and later
		      because the laissez faire attitude had become a
		      habit or even a national affectation.  Americans
		      have always been free to test the limits in ways
		      that the Europeans could not attempt.  If many
		      of these testings of the limits, in retrospect,
		      turn out to be confidence games, it wasn't the
		      original intention. </p> 
		      <p>This makes sense.  Americans were able to
		      invent real estate swindles because they had an
		      entire continent to steal from the aboriginal
		      occupants and then to sell to each other as
		      often as possible.  McDougall's history of the
		      states which joined the union up to 1828 is an
		      unrelenting history of real estate peculators.
		      Even George Washington, his other qualities
		      notwithstanding, had large interests in western
		      real estate in his day.</p> 
		      <p>As long as we focus on the real estate
		      aspects, there's another author who gives
		      extensive testimony to the creativity and
		      invention of Americans.  Hernando de Soto is a
		      Peruvian engineer who wants to capitalize the
		      third world.  De Soto's book, The Mystery of
		      Capital, spends a good deal of effort explaining
		      how the property law of the United States was
		      rewritten repeatedly by squatters as the
		      "settlers" moved west and persuaded the law to
		      recognize their possession was more than
		      nine-tenths of anything that mattered.  We're
		      still sorting out some of these creativities
		      here in New Mexico, where much of the original
		      Spanish land grants were converted to Anglo real
		      estate.</p> 
		      <p>It seems that Lawrence Lessig's Free Culture,
		      which I have not yet had the pleasure of
		      reading, is arguing for a similar American
		      creativity in both the enclosure and liberation
		      of intellectual property rights.  On the one
		      hand, he notes the "piratical" origins of
		      Hollywood, which relocated from New York to the
		      left coast to elude enforcement of Edison's
		      moving picture patents.  On the other hand, he
		      rails against the attempts of big media to carve
		      their property rights out of the
		      commonwealth. </p> 
		      <p>I also find echoes of this idea in Louis
		      Menand's story of the pragmatists:  Holmes,
		      Peirce, James and Dewey.</p> 
		      <p>Looking over the list at left, I have to
		      wonder whether the Americans really deserve all
		      the credit.  A lot of the words to the left are
		      obviously English English.  The English had
		      already enclosed the commons, forced marginal
		      tenants off the land, and had their South Sea
		      Bubble by the time the Americans had barely
		      gotten started. One could further argue that
		      this was neither a peculiarly British nor an
		      American enterprise.  The Oxford English
		      Dictionary tells that the word swindle itself
		      comes from the German schwindeln.</p> 
		      <p>Whether we call this a purely American
		      speciality or decide to spread the blame more
		      widely, it is clear that the Americans have not
		      been slackers.  It is also clear that there are
		      more varieties of swindle than there are of
		      snow.</p> 
		      <p>So, what happens when you take this American
		      unbridled "opportunity to pursue ambitions" and
		      encode its principles into an international
		      telecommunication network designed to route its
		      way around congestion, censorship, legal
		      niceties, ethical qualms, and obstructions of
		      any other kind? Easy, right?  You get a world
		      that's learning a more than a few new words
		      connoting swindle, and teaching us some new
		      ones, too. The internet has given the world
		      "more opportunity to pursue their ambitions by
		      fair means or foul", and they've taken the
		      bait.</p> 
		      <p>Nigerian 419 scams, Romanian teenagers
			running fraudulent auctions on EBay, phishers
			counterfeiting every webpage that might
			reasonably request a credit card number, the
			Russian mafia colonizing residential broadband
			connections, the Phatbot worm with it's p2p
			network for distributing DDOS commands among
			its peers, the netsky/bagle/mydoom virus
			writing olympics delivered to your inbox fresh
			each morning, the witty worm eating up all of
			the vulnerable firewalls in the world in about
			30 minutes, and ..., and ..., and whatever
			turns up next, which has probably been posted
			to Slashdot while I was writing this.</p> 
		      <p>Call it spam, or scam, or spyware, or virus,
		      or worm.  It may be deplorable, but it's also a
		      triumph of the American way. For every scheme
		      that's clearly crossed over to the dark side of
		      human intercourse, there are another dozen which
		      are clearly or arguably okay, or perhaps only
		      slightly nauseating. There are, after all, a lot
		      of Americans who find marketing, ie the
		      persuasion of people that they need to consume,
		      a somewhat dubious activity.</p> 
		      <p>So, remember, never give a sucker an even break.  They are the only natural resource which we cannot exhaust.</p>
