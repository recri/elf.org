                    <h1>Doodle History</h1>
          <p>
            It must have been late in 1996 or early in 1997 that Dave
            Sturman visited San Francisco, stopped by our house, and
            happened to show off his new PalmPilot.  I soon had my own
            and started trying to teach it new tricks.
          </p><p>
            George Howlett's Scribble, now disappeared from the net,
            inspired Doodle both by providing the source code for a
            Pilot application to work from, and by providing an
            example of a paint program which was too minimalist to
            keep this doodler happy. Scribble occupied about 2000
            bytes on your Palm.
          </p><p>
            This was by far the smallest drawing application available
            for the Palm.  Others, sizes and dates from my archives,
            from the same era were:
          <ul>
            <li>20165 Jul 30  1996 dinkypad.prc</li>
            <li>2003 Jan 28  1997 SCRIBBLE.PRC</li>
            <li>4729 Mar 19  1997 ScratchPad.prc</li>
            <li>3816 Apr 15  1997 doodle.prc v 0.2</li>
            <li>5372 Apr 26  1997 doodle.prc v.0.6</li>
            <li>25752 May 30  1997 hdsketch.prc</li>
            <li>37531 Jun  4  1997 palmdraw.prc</li>
          </ul>
          The dates are most likely the dates of construction by the
          author since most of these came in zip files.
          </p><p>
            The initial Doodle
            releases in
            <a href="download/dood02.prc">March</a>
            and
            <a href="download/dood06.prc">April</a> of 1997
            rewrote Scribble from assembly code into a C program.  I
            also increased the variety of drawing modes, pens and
            inks, and added some stroke smoothing to reduce the
            jitters.  The end result was a program that occupied about
            6000 bytes, and a personal aversion to programming on the
            Palm.
          </p><p>
            In September 1997 Kees Moerman filled Doodle's most
            obvious missing link by writing a Windows program,
            <a href="http://www.keesmoerman.nl/doo2pcxe.html">Doo2pcx</a>,
            which converted DoodleDB.pdb into a collection of .pcx
            format images.  Thanks, Kees.
          </p><p>
            In December 1998, Tom Zerucha sent a patch to add page
            beaming.  Not having any way to test it, and still
            suffering from my Palm programming aversion, the patch
            languished in my mailbox.  Thanks, Tom.
         </p><p>
            In March 1999 IDG Books asked permission to include Doodle
            in PalmOS Programming for Dummies.
         </p><p>
            In May 1999 I received a query from Mitch Blevins 
            about adapting Doodle into a new program, Diddle. This
            soon came to pass.  Diddle fixed the bug I'd never figured
            out, and added the mechanical drawing tools and text 
            handling features that I hadn't considered necessary for a
            doodling application, and the image beaming and linking
            facilities that hadn't existed at the time of Doodle's
            release.  And the program grew to 28000 bytes.
          </p><p>
            Diddle, in turn, soon grew into a program called  
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/diddlebug/">
              DiddleBug</a>, a combination note doodler and alarm
            setting program.  The last release of DiddleBug by Mitch
            was 2.15 which holds 10th place on the list of most
            downloaded applications at
            <a href="http://www.palmgear.com">PalmGear</a>.
          </p><p>
            The current version of
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/diddlebug/">DiddleBug</a><br>
            is hosted at
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net">Source Forge</a>
            and maintained by Peter Putzer.  If you're still using
            DiddleBug 2.15, you really should upgrade because Peter
            has done much excellent work on the program.  But the
            program has grown to 120000 bytes.
          </p><p>
            In June 1999 Chris Antos sent a fix for the menu capture
            bug.  Thanks, Chris.
          </p><p>
            Sometime in 1999-2000, Doodle inspired Howard Katseff
            at ATT Research Labs to produce
            <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~hpk/doodlemail/">
               DoodleMail
            </a>, a PalmOS e-mail client which allowed transfer of
            doodles between clients.
          </p><p>
            In May 2002 I received a patched version of Doodle from
            Rod Morehead which upgraded the build environment for the
            changes in the past five years and provided a fix for
            the color display problem.  Thanks, Rod.
          </p><p>
            The current release of Doodle has benefited greatly from
            the many fixes and enhancements written by Mitch Blevins,
            Peter Putzer, and the many others who contributed to the
            development of Diddle and DiddleBug.  This is one of the
            strange creative relationships that open source software
            allows you to enter into:  you write your code, you give
            it away, and it comes back to you years later, all grown
            up.  Portions of DiddleBug were incorporated wholesale,
            some in pieces, and all of it was studied with
            appreciation.
          </p><p>
            But the strangest part of rediscovering Doodle, after all
            these years, was that all of it was still there.  When I
            went through the source code of DiddleBug 2.52 attempting
            to trim it back to the original Doodle plus those features
            I thought I might want to keep, I found that the original
            Doodle was intact, and substantially unchanged.  In the
            end it was easier to build up from Doodle 0.6 to the new
            release, using the DiddleBug sources as a source of ideas.  
          </p><p>
            Writing the first Doodle I discovered that
            a user interface can work much differently on a pen
            based computer. Since doodling consists of scribbling
            with the stylus on the screen of your Palm, it's quite
            natural to change pens or inks by reaching into the
            graffiti area and scribbling a command character.  It's
            almost as if you reached out with your stylus and dipped
            it into a one ink pot of an array, but the palette of
            inks is organized gesturally in the graffiti stroke
            "space" rather than arranged physically in your
            workspace.  The result is that the mechanics of the user
            interface for Doodle do not fight with the mechanics
            of doodling - there are no rectilinear menus that must
            be traversed and there are no tool bars stealing
            eye-share from your doodle, it's just you, your stylus,
            and a field of empty pixels to be filled.
          </p><p>
            Doodle 0.8 retains the simplicity of the original
            interface while adding a few features and still remaining
            quite compact at around 22000 bytes.  The Add and Subtract
            Ink modes allow you to touch up your doodles by darkening
            or lightening areas.  The Shift Ink operator allows you to
            use the basic inks in different alignments.  The Pick Ink
            and Pick Pen dialogs allow you to build up your own
            palettes and toolboxes.
