	  <b>Colorcube Colophon</b>
	  <hr>
	  <p>
	    <a href="index.html">Colorcube</a> presents the slice of a plane
	    through the
	    <a href="http://www.lynda.com">browser safe palette</a>,
	    a 6x6x6 colorcube which the major browsers support on 8
	    bit color displays.  When the plane exits the cube before
	    a complete 6x6 slice is completed, it is wrapped back
	    through for another pass. Pressing on a frame button
	    alters the plane.  There may be some bugs yet to be worked
	    out.  Looking at it, I'm not sure that I believe my own
	    explanation of how it works just now, but it does generate
	    some interesting combinations of colors to look at.
	  <p>
	    By default, colorcube uses
	    <code>src=&quot;javascript:gifdata&quot;</code>
	    urls to display images. This means that images are
	    downloaded in javascript source rather than as image
	    files.  The archive of images downloaded by colorcube
	    contains all the 1 by 1 gifs in any color specified by 24
	    bits of RGB, the (always fashionable) 1 by 1 transparent
	    gif image, and a single image for our frame.  The 2^24
	    color gifs are, obviously, synthesized on the fly rather
	    than enumerated in the source file which is only 2455
	    bytes large.
	  <p>
	    An alternative implementation of colorcube is available
	    through the <a href="index.html%3Ftrue.html">Use Gifs</a> link.
	    In this case the page will download the necessary gifs
	    from my server rather than synthesizing them inline.  This
	    should allow a comparison between inline and individually
	    served images.
	  <p>
	    In principle this method of encoding images could be used
	    to convert whole collections of images into javascript
	    source, which could then archived and compressed into a
	    jar file with the rest of a site's javascript, and all
	    delivered with a single http transfer.  Then rather than
	    waiting and wondering when, or if, the rest of images
	    required for rendering a page would be coughed up by the
	    server, one would know that they were all present as soon
	    as the archive arrived. 
	  <p>
	    Support for these constructs appears to be in the version 4
	    browsers.  Thus far I've verified the following:
	  <center><table border="0">
	      <tr><th>Browser</th><th>Version</th><th>Platform</th><th>Support</th></tr>
	      <tr><td>Netscape</td><td>4.07</td><td>Linux</td><td>yes</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>Netscape</td><td>4.07</td><td>Mac</td><td>yes</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>Netscape</td><td>4.51</td><td>Linux</td><td>yes</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>Netscape</td><td>4.51</td><td>Win95</td><td>yes</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>Netscape</td><td>4.51</td><td>Mac</td><td>yes</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>IExplorer</td><td>4.01</td><td>Win95</td><td>?</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>IExplorer</td><td>5.0</td><td>Win95</td><td>?</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>Opera</td><td>3.51</td><td>Win95</td><td>?</td></tr>
	    </table></center>
	  Explorer worked with the page I used yesterday, but both
	  4.01 and 5.0 fail today, so there must be some borderline
	  portable code in my javascript. Please
	  <a href="mailto:info@elf.org">send me</a> any examples of
	  support or non support which alter or extend this table, or
	  corrections to the code which allow it to run on more
	  platforms.  Opera doesn't display either the giflet or the
	  gif version of the colorcube page.
	  <p>
	    My original goal was to find any way that a JavaScript
	    program could compute graphics and insert the computed
	    graphics into a web page.  One possibility was to use
	  <pre><code>
document.open('image/gif');
document.write(image_gif_data);</code></pre>
	  to write gif images into selected documents.  It turns out,
	  after much fruitless effort on my part, that while
	  <code>document.open()</code> will open documents with mime
	  type 'image/gif' <code>document.write()</code> cannot write
	  the character with value 0, which makes it very difficult to
	  write gif file data.
	  <p>
	    A second possibility was to use
      <a href="ftp://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-masinter-url-data-03.txt">
	      data urls</a> in which the value of a small object can
	    be encoded inline as base64 content.  Since the data in a
	    tag is limited, in worst case, to 1024 bytes, only fairly
	    small images could be displayed this way.
	  <p>
	    As luck would have it, I asked for help on the
	    comp.lang.javascript newsgroup, and
	    <a href="http://www.irt.org/">Martin Webb</a> came up with
	    a third solution to the problem.  This uses a javascript
	    url to supply the data for the <code>src=</code> field of
	    an image. The data is neither written nor encoded, it is
	    simply supplied as the result of a javascript expression.
	    Thus we may write a url as:
	    <code><pre>javascript:'GIF89a\1\0\1\0\200[...]\1\0;'</pre></code>
	  which specifies the 1 pixel square transparent gif as a
	  javascript literal string.  Or we might store that data into
	  a global variable:
	  <code><pre>var trans = 'GIF89a\1\0\1\0\200[...]\1\0;'</pre></code>
	  and then write the url as:
	  <code><pre>javascript:transparent</pre></code>
