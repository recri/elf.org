			<a name="goals"><b>Goals</b></a>
		      </p>
		      <p>
			I am very interested, and very effective, in
			using  computers, computer graphics, and graphical user
			interfaces to facilitate the understanding of
			mathematical, physical, chemical, biological,
			informational and  business processes.  I am
			currently working full time.
		      </p>
		      <p>
			<a name="skills"><b>Skills</b></a>
		      </p>
		      <p>
			I am an excellent programmer in C, Tcl/Tk,
			Java, and Javascript.  I have been reading,
			writing, and rewriting programs in the C
			programming language since the 70's, in Tcl
			and Tk since the early 90's, Java since the
			mid 90's, and Javascript since the late 90's.
			I have worked on language compilers, operating
			systems, utility programs, scripting language
			interpreters, software development tools, and
			libraries.  I write efficient code, I do it
			quickly, and it keeps on working. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			Although my formal training ended with a
			bachelors degree in chemistry, I am quite
			comfortable researching the scientific
			literature in many fields, including
			population biology, computer science, software
			engineering, machine learning,  molecular
			biology, combinatorial chemistry, experimental
			design, computer graphics, agent based
			modeling, geometric algebras, and
			optimization.  I can take original technical
			papers in a variety of disciplines and
			translate them directly into working code. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			I have been successful in applying my
			programming and scientific skills for a great
			variety of clients.   I have produced code for
			software engineers, computer scientists,
			chemists, biologists, computer game companies,
			physicists, mathematicians, logistics experts,
			and artists.  I am able to listen to and talk
			with people about their desires, needs, and
			requirements.  I can find and use the parts of
			the scientific literature applicable to their
			problems. I am able to produce a quality
			product that meets their specifications. 
		      </p>

			<a name="history"><b>History</b></a>
		      </p>
		      <p>
			Most recently I've been working as an
			independent consultant.  My work has included
			simulating fiesta crowds for the Santa Fe
			Police Department, maintaining combinatorial
			chemistry software for the Chiron Corporation,
			constructing a PalmOS based handwriting 
			trainer,  building client hosted Javascript
			tools for web based GIS applications, and
			mentoring the next generation of computational
			scientists here in New Mexico. A particular
			interest is the adaptation of agent based
			modeling and complex adaptive systems concepts
			to computer facilitated negotiations in
			situations of intractable conflict.  
		      </p>
		      <p>
			From 2000-2002 I worked for the BiosGroup in
			Santa Fe, NM, a consulting firm founded by
			Stuart Kauffman.  My principal projects there
			were with Walgreens, United Airlines, the US
			Transportation Command, and Southwest
			Airlines. The Walgreens' project involved
			building, on very short notice,  a Java
			simulation of their largest warehouse to
			validate its ability to handle the
			unprecedented peak loads expected in the fall
			of 2000.  We found that the warehouse had
			insufficient capacity for restocking pick
			areas under peak conditions. With Tony Plate I
			developed and delivered a simulation of
			operations and maintenance for the United
			narrow body fleet in order to explore
			prioritization strategies for maintenance
			items under different airline operating
			conditions.  I reviewed the existing tools at
			US Transportation Command for simulation of
			troop deployment scheduling for air and sea
			transport and persuaded them that
			incorporating more modern scheduling
			technologies was both possible and
			desirable. With Fred Seibel I analyzed the
			Southwest schedules for 2001 and 2002 with
			respect to maintainability and on time
			performance.  We found that Southwest had some
			lessons to learn from the scheduling
			construction practices of its competitors. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			In 1998-2000 I worked as an independent
			software contractor, develping Tcl/Tk based
			tools for clients in the pharmaceutical and
			electronic games industries. My
			collaborator <a href="http://www.dipaola.org">Steve
			Dipaola</a> has a very nice page
			describing <a ref="http://www.dipaola.org/steve/facelift.html">FaceLift</a>,
			a character face generator we developed for
			Maxis/EA as part of the release of The Sims. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			In 1997-1998 I worked for Daylight Chemical
			Information Systems at their Research Office
			in Santa Fe, NM.  I developed scripting
			language interfaces for their toolkits. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			In 1995-1997 I worked with Jeff Blaney's
			computational group in Drug Discovery Research
			at Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, CA, first
			as a contractor and later as a full time
			employee.  Working with Eric Martin, I
			automated a combinatorial synthesis design
			system using Tcl/Tk and       other tools.
			This system is used to help chemists choose
			maximally diverse sets of reagents, given the
			constraints of the chemistry involved, for use
			in combinatorial syntheses, where hundreds,
			thousands, or ten-thousands of compounds are
			produced in parallel.  The automation of the
			tool reduced the elapsed time for designs from
			weeks to
			hours <a href="author.html#ref6">[6,7]</a>. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			In 1989 I became one of the founding employees
			of Arris Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, MA, a
			startup founded to combine advances in cell
			biology, combinatorial synthesis, and
			artificial intelligence for drug design.  I
			learned to use Tcl/Tk at Arris and built
			systems which visualized the  operation of the
			directed learning systems we built to identify
			structure-function relationships in molecules
			with biological
			effects <a href="author.html#ref3">[3,4,5]</a>. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			In 1982-1989 I worked for the Mark Williams
			Company in Chicago, one of the great also-rans
			of the computer age. I retargeted their c
			compiler to the 68000, participated in the
			port of Coherent, a UNIX V7 clone, to the
			IBM-PC, produced the MWC c development system
			for the Atari-ST, and actually ported Coherent
			to the Atari ST, although that never became a
			product.  I also participated in the design
			and production of <i>ANSI C: A Lexical
			Guide</i> <a href="author.html#ref2">[2]</a>. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			In 1979-1981 I worked for the Sidereal
			Corporation, a manufacturer of computerized
			teletype terminals then located in Portland,
			Oregon.  I retargeted the Kernighan and
			Ritchie UNIX c compiler to the 68000
			architecture at the same time that Chris
			Terman was doing similar work at MIT using
			Steve Johnson's PCC package. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			In 1978-1979 I worked at Reed on an NSF grant,
			starting under Dave DeSante and finishing
			under Steven Stearns, to develop computer
			programs for teaching population biology. This
			produced demonstrations of predator-prey
			interactions, competitive exclusion, the
			chaotic possiblilities of discrete logistic
			growth, and other models, all programmed in my
			own language which implemented matrix and
			vector operations in a free interpretation of
			Dirac's bra-ket notation.  It also produced a
			paper<a href="author.html#ref1">[1]</a>
			criticizing Joel Cohen's <i>Food Webs and
			Niche Space</i> for misunderstanding the
			mathematical methods it introduced for
			analysis of trophic relations. 
		      </p>
		      <p>
			I graduated from Reed College in 1978 with a
			degree in Chemistry and a concentration in
			Biology.  My senior thesis examined the
			expected frequencies of palindromes in DNA
			sequences by comparing their frequencies in
			native DNA to their frequencies the same
			sequences transformed by global transition,
			transversion, and transition-transversion
			mutations, and employed lots of nifty
			monochrome graphics printed from the Tektronix
			4014 terminals onto their dedicated thermal
			printer.
