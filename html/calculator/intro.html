	  <b>Geometric Calculator - Introduction</b>
	  <p>
	    This calculator differs from most you've met before in
	    that it computes with Clifford numbers rather than the
	    plain old numbers that you're used to seeing.  As a
	    consequence, this calculator can compute directly what
	    other calculators compute as an afterthought with
	    extensive subprograms.
	  <p>
	    Clifford Algebras were invented by William K. Clifford in
	    the 19th century.  While world reknowned physicists were
	    debating whether vectors or quaternions were the more
	    appropriate medium for expressing physics, Clifford
	    quietly incorporated vectors and quaternions into a system
	    of geometric algebras which worked better than either
	    alone and generalized in ways that neither could.
	  <p>
	    Plain old numbers are, as it happens, part of Clifford's
	    scheme, so as long as you stick to plain old numbers and
	    plain old computations, then this calculator will work
	    just like the other <a
	      href="http://www.hpmuseum.org/rpn.htm">RPN desk
	      calculators</a> that you already know.  Plain old
	    numbers are called scalars.
	  <p>
	    Vectors are, as it happens, also part of Clifford's
	    scheme, so you can use the <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, and
	    <b>z</b> keys on this calculator to enter the unit basis
	    vectors in the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> directions
	    and implicitly multiply them by the plain old number
	    you've entered.  You can add and subtract vectors and
	    multiply them by scalars. 
	  <p>
	    In Clifford's geometric scheme of things, scalars
	    represent pure magnitudes and vectors represent oriented
	    lengths.  To continue the geometric scheme we need
	    <i>things</i> which represent oriented areas and oriented
	    volumes.  These are called bivectors, because two vectors
	    define an area, and trivectors, because three vectors (or
	    a vector and a bivector) define a volume.
	  <p>
	    The unit basis bivectors are <b>xy</b>, <b>yz</b>, and
	    <b>zx</b> each representing a unit area in the plane named
	    by the basis. The unit trivector basis is <b>xyz</b>
	    representing a unit volume.  All of which you can enter by
	    simply typing the appropriate keys or by multiplying
	    together the unit basis vectors.
	  <p>
	    Adding all this up, our numbers are multivectors
	    consisting of a scalar part, a vector part, a bivector
	    part, and a trivector part.  This may strike you as a bit
	    awkward at first, somewhat like adding apples and oranges
	    and bananas and pomegranates.  We have 8 different kinds
	    of fruit to keep straight, each of which is labelled by
	    its unit basis when it appears in a number: <b>x</b>,
	    <b>y</b>, <b>z</b>, <b>xy</b>, <b>yz</b>, <b>zx</b>, and
	    <b>xyz</b>.  The eighth basis would be <b>1</b>, the
	    scalar unit basis, which we don't actually write.
	  <p>
	    There are many interesting consequences of calculating
	    with geometrically defined numbers, which David Hestenes
	    develops in depth.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Calculations with the plain old numbers embedded in
	      the geometric numbers work just as they always have. 
	    <li>Calculations with the plain old two- and
	      three-dimensional vectors embedded in the geometric
	      numbers work just as they always have.
	    <li>Calculations with numbers of the form <i>a</i> +
	      <i>b</i><b>xy</b> work very much like complex numbers
	      with <b>xy</b> serving as the imaginary unit.  The same
	      is true if <b>yz</b> or <b>zx</b> is used as an
	      imaginary unit.
	    <li>Calculations with numbers of the form <i>s</i> +
	      <i>i</i><b>xy</b> + <i>j</i><b>yz</b> +
	      <i>k</i><b>zx</b> work very much like Hamilton's
	      quaternions.
	    <li>Calculations of areas and volumes are simple and
	      direct, even for complex figures.
	    <li>If <b>a</b> is a unit vector and <b>B</b> is any
	      Clifford number, then <b>-aBa</b> is the Clifford number
	      with all its parts reflected in the plane orthogonal to
	      <b>a</b>.
	    <li>If <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are unit vectors and <b>C</b>
	      is any Clifford number, then <b>abCba</b> is the
	      Clifford number with all its parts rotated in the
	      <b>ab</b> plane by twice the angle between <b>a</b> and
	      <b>b</b>.  If we write <b>q</b> = <b>ab</b>, then the
	      rotation formula becomes <b>qCq*</b>.
	    <li>The plane geometry included within the geometric
	      numbers allows for solution of problems of plane
	      geometry, including terrestrial surveying and navigation
	      problems.
	    <li>The quaternion algebra included within the geometric
	      numbers allows for solution of spherical geometry
	      problems, including spherical trigonometry, celestial
	      navigation, spacecraft attitude, and robot pose
	      problems.
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    In time, this introduction will grow into a more detailed
	    introduction and explanation of why you want to take a
	    <b>Geometric Calculator</b> with you when you leave Earth.
	    Whether you're bound for a life in deep space or a colony
	    on another planet, don't leave home without it.
