                <h1>Doodle Fan Mail</h1>
	  <p>
	    None of my projects have generated as much ongoing response
	    as <a href="index.html">Doodle</a>.  That's probably
	    because it had one bug which everyone needed to tell me
	    about, but there were also some nice things said.  These
	    comments cover several years and several continents. 
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    I just loaded your Pilot app. Doodle ver 0.2 today.  Great
	    program!  [ ... ]  I used Dinkypad and Scratchpad and your
	    program has the most features.
	    <br>
	    Congratulations.
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    What a great little program!  I love the italic pens -
	    it's fun to "doodle" with them during boring
	    teleconferences.  It's great for practicing calligraphy.
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    Just wanted to tell you how much I like the Doodle
	    program.  I feel that the drawing algorithm you use is
	    much faster and smoother than the one that DinkyPad
	    (another amazing program!) uses.
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    I've been looking for an excuse to remove my Dinky
	    Pad. Thanks to your new "doodler" program I've been able
	    to do that. A suggestion for future updates. Could an
	    animation or auto-scroll feature be applied? This would
	    allow for the pages to advance from 1 to ? I am happy to
	    use my scroll buttons for now. If any change will cause
	    problems leave it alone.
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    I love using your version of this graphic program for the
	    Pilot.  I really don't need all the 'bells and whistles'
	    of DinkyPad and Scribble and ScratchPad are just 'not the
	    ticket'.<br>
	    This really fits my needs and I trust that it does for
	    many other Piloteers.<br>
	    Thanks again for the program.  I'm looking forward to the
	    next update.
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    <a name="arabic">
	    doodle is more than great (the italic pen makes caligraphy
	    possible - and since Arabic is such
	    an artistic language to write, it suits me perfectly)<br>
	    DinkyPad doesn't allow such good caligraphy, plus the
	    virtual canvas business maybe an advantage but not such a
	    big one, because u don't even need to make a command
	    stroke on your app, just write 'N' and u got more
	    space..<br>
	    really roger, thanks a million for writing a good app...
	    </a>
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    I have been using your doodle program on my pilot and love
	    it.  You have done a great job of making things simple an
	    efficient.
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    Just found your shareware. Nice. Love the Pilot and the
	    drawing fills a need felt when I gave up the paper
	    daytimer.

	  <blockquote>
	    Great Program!!!<br>
	    It is nice to see a tight little functional program in
	    todays environment of sloppy code writing and gluttonous
	    memory usage.
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    I have to say Doodle is excellent - and very small. Holds
	    multiple doodles.
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    Again, kudos on the great idea and program.  If I can be
	    of assistance, please tell me how!

	  <blockquote>
	    <a name="like-an-artist">
	    Love your Doodle, I think it's one of the best Pilot paint
	    programs, with features designed by somebody who thinks
	    more like an artist than a
	    programmer.

	    Recently I have downloaded Your programm Doodle 0.6. This

	    Doodle is pretty amazing and I've found it's great for

	    <a name="empty-page">
	    I have been playing with as many of the pilot drawing
	    programs as I can find.  Yours is by far the most
	    intersting.  I especially like the empty page feeling of
	      the program. Reading your notes, I agree with your ideas
	      about the ink pot feeling.  You seem to have done some work to on
	    getting the feel of the inkflow correct and smooth.  Many
	    other prgrams have a very jittery line.

	    I just wanted to let you know that I really like Doodle

	  <blockquote>
	    Wow!  Great app!  Wow!  I just downloaded every sketchpad,
	    doodlepad, and paintpad I could find on the internet and
	    tried them all out.  Yours is the one that's staying on my
	    Pilot.  No contest.<br>
	    Thanks for a great little time-waster.

	    Just wanted so thanks you making such a nice prog (now

	  <blockquote>
	    Althogh many pen draw programs have few handy features
	    like new page when scrolled before 1st or beyond last
	    page, or even with hardware button, graffiti text in
	    clipboard capture etc, still I think doodle makes THE BEST
	    pen write thanks to its medium smooth option. So have I
	    decided to assign Doodle to 4th hardware button.
	  </blockquote>

	  <blockquote>
	    While looking for a small drawing application for my new
	    palm pilot I came across doodle - and found it very
	    useful. At this point: thank you for providing it as freeware.
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    I've been running doodle 0.6 for several months now and
	    have found that it has the best drawing engine that I've
	    found to date for the PalmPilot. The smoothing
	    capabilities you've included are incomparable for speed
	    and ease of use. The user interface is fast and intuitive
	    (though the pen tip selection and ink selection sometimes
	    slows me down a bit, since there are so many options). Its
	    main strengths are intuitive user interface, drawing
	    quality (no jumpy lines), and drawing speed.
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    I'm hoping this is still the right address for the person
	    who wrote the excellent pilot applet Doodle.. Great
	    stuff! I tried a few drawing  applets, but Doodle is the
	    simplest and most elegant to use. I make  sketches for
	    animations, it's so easy. Thanks! I did manage to loose
	    the  documentation that came with the .prc. If Doodle is
	    shareware I haven't payed my dues yet - sorry.

	    Did you know compared to other handwriting programs,
	    Doodle makes the most beautiful Chinese characters.

	    By the way I just wanted you to know your program is great
	    :-)) Keep up the great work.

	  <blockquote>
	    "Doodle" is the greatest program I have ever seen.  OK, I
	    may overstate it a bit, but it is a fun utility that
	    couldn't be more intuitive to use.

	    I am new to palm Pilots and i was after a drawing

	    <a name="botanical">
	    I would first like to say how much I like "Doodle". I have
	    also Dinky pad and sketch pad, but Doodle is the one I
	    always end up using most. It offers the best tools for
	    real drawing. I am doing picture-records of botanical specimens in the field,
	    with great satisfaction.

	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>
	  <blockquote>
	    I downloaded "Doodle" from Ray's Pilot Archives.  I didn't
	    get any documentation or registration files with it, just
	    the *.prc app fill.  I can't find any
	    registration/shareware info in the app itself.  However, I
	    figured an app this good could still be shareware.  Do I
	    owe you anything if I keep using it, or will my comments
	    and suggestion (very few) suffice?  Let me know.  If you
	    want my suggestions, I'll send them.<br>
	    Two things I REALLY, REALLY like:<br>
	    1.Very small size--AWESOME!!!!!!!<br>
	    2.Smoothing of writing--It makes my signature look soooooo
	    much better than DinkyPad!!

	    Just wanted to take a minute to let you know how much I
	    love the Doodle program for my Palm Pilot.  It is EXACTLY
	    what I was looking for - someplace that I can write text
	    on the fly without having to worry if my Graffiti
	    characters are right.<br>
	    Nice job!
	  </blockquote>
        <hr width="100" align="center"/>

	    I really love your program. Its the best doodling program

	    I like doodle v0.6 very much. Thanks for making it!

      I am so happy to find a later version of Doodle from 0.2,
      which I have happily been using on a Palm 5000 for four
      years.
