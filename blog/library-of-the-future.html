        <h2>Welcome to the Library of the Future</h2>
        <div class="clear-block"><div id="node-34" class="node">
	    <div class="content clear-block">
	      Years ago I conceived a desire to read
	      Hamilton's <i>Elements of Quaternions</i>.  This was
	      part of my independent study of geometric algebras
	      inspired by working on molecular dynamics and reading
	      David Hestenes.   There's a geometric algebra desk
	      calculator lurking around <a href="../calculator">here</a>
	      somewhere, desperately in need of a rework which I
	      promise should happen real soon now.   
	      <br/>
	      <br/>
	      But back to this craving to read Sir William Rowan
	      Hamilton in the original.  Reading the original works of
	      scientists is unfashionable.  Academics would much
	      rather you read their redactions of the originals, for
	      which they imagine they will get fame and royalties,
	      than you look to the actual words of the scientists who
	      made the discoveries in the first place.  It's quite the
	      racket.  Search for "probability" on amazon.com and
	      you'll find lots and lots of books by professors and
	      others professing to explain everything you need to
	      know, and almost nothing by the mathematicians who
	      worked out the rules of the game that all these
	      professors, and others, are making their livings off of.
	      I cornered a professor of mine about this, and he
	      squirmed, noted that St Johns College used original
	      works for their science classes, but that most people
	      considered the originals too hard, or too dated, or too
	      .... 
	      <br/>
	      <br/>
	      Reading original works is also damned difficult.  In the
	      case of Hamilton,  there weren't that many copies in the
	      world.  As it turned out, I needed to move to a large
	      university town and cultivate a relationship with a
	      large university library if I ever wanted to see a copy
	      of Hamilton's <i>Quaternions</i>.  This was too much
	      work on top of the day job.  Then I found a digitized
	      copy at the Cornell University library on line.  But
	      they were serving it up a page at a time, a real winner
	      of a user interface for a book that was 800 to 1200
	      pages depending on the edition.  And when I attempted to
	      gather the pages with an automatic script, I ended up
	      blocked from access entirely.  Sigh. 
	      <br/>
	      <br/>
	      Those days are now officially over.   In the past few
	      weeks, as a result of looking up original sources in
	      probability, in showing my mom how to provision the Sony
	      EReader I gifted her, I happened to search for "hamilton
	      quaternions" at http://archive.org and I found multiple
	      scanned copies available for download, first and second
	      editions.  And I found <i>Popul&auml;re Schriften</i>
	      and <i>Vorlesungen &uuml;ber Gastheorie</i> von
	      Dr. Ludwig Boltzmann.   And I found the <i>Mathematical
	      Papers</i> by William Kingdon Clifford, along with
	      copies of several less weighty science works.  And I
	      found <i>Elementary Principles of Statistical
	      Mechanics</i>, <i>Elements of Vector Analysis</i>,
	      and <i>The Scientific Papers</i> of J. Willard Gibbs.
	      And I found Hermann Grassmann's <i>Gesammelte
	      Mathematische and Physikalische Werke</i>, as edited by
	      Friedrich Engel, not to be confused with Friedrich
	      Engels.   And I found <i>The Scientific Papers</i> of
	      James Clerk Maxwell.  And I found all these sources in
	      probability: Cardano, Bernoulli, Pascal, Fermat, and
	      Laplace.  Finally, I found a copy of "one of the most
	      quoted and least read books" in the world, von Neumann
	      and Morgenstern, <i>Theory of Games and Economic
	      Behavior</i>.  Thank you, Osmania University Library,
	      where ever you are, and thank you, Google, for doing the
	      really heavy lifting. 
	      <br/>
	      <br/>
	      And if your tastes run to less technical topics, well I
	      found copies of <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Finnegan's
	      Wake</i> which are going onto my cell phone and laptop
	      for those moments when watching cat fights on YouTube
	      just doesn't satisfy. 
	      <br/>
	      <br/>
	      So the library of the future works like Samuel Clemens
	      reading newspapers  --  you can download anything that's
	      greater than X years in age, and whether it's a load of
	      manure should be clear by the time you get around to
	      reading it.  For the privilege of pawing through more
	      recently manufactured manure, thou shalt pay the
	      manufacturer his or her due, or visit the public library
	      and borrow a copy.  But almost everything that has
	      really contributed to our understanding of ourselves and
	      our world should soon be available to those who can read
	      and can download.  Amazing world.
